Hurdle-1
========

This was the source code for my solution to the first problem for admission to Ph11.
Ph11 is a Caltech research group/class that offers more advanced research opportunities than Caltech's other undergraduate research programs.
To get admitted to the class, you have to solve two open-ended problems called "hurdles".  Every year, about 50 people apply to Ph11, and the top 5-6 solutions are accepted. I was accepted into the 2014 Ph11 class.
The second problem was not something I solved computationally, so it's not on GitHub.
